<h2>Execution report for the created API collection </h2>

Below you can find the execution report that was generated through the Postman collection runner. <br>

![execution runner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e617581d-81c4-400c-9436-7b59315563ea)<br>

The collection was also run through newman directly from the terminal, and the results can be found below:<br>

<h2>Defects found</h2>

The following issues were identified while running the postman tests:<br>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

In this project, I tested the DummyJSON application`s API using postman to manage API requests and define tests. For running the execution report, I utilized both the Collection Runner directly from Postman and Newman.
I executed 15 HTTP requests and 65 tests, of which 56 tests ran succesfully while 9 failed. Upon analyzing the results, I identified 5 bugs, including:  

- The request for a non-existent product category returns a status code of 200 instead 404.
- Creating a new product with invalid data is permited.
- The error message is not returned.
- A product can be updated without some of the required fields such as price, category etc.
- A product can be partially updated with invalid data.
          
These bugs highlight fundamental issues with validation and error handling in the API.
The lack of  proper validation can lead to unpredictable application behavior, allowing inconsistent or incomplete data in the database. Aditionally, incorrect status code response can mislead users.
In conclusion, launching the application without addressing these bugs could significantly impact functionality and user trust.
